Project Specification
Code a Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz
You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean. 
Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.

For this project you'll be building a fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt 
a user with a sentence containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill 
in each blank appropriately to complete the sentence. This can be used as a study tool 
to help you remember important vocabulary!

You can find some starter code for this project along with all the other lessons in the 
Supporting Materials below.

In addition to the starter code file (fill-in-the-blanks.py) we've also given you a file
called fill-in-the-blanks.pyc which is a working version of the project. A .pyc file is 
a Python file that has been translated into "byte code". This means the code will run the
same as the original .py file, but if you open it in your text editor, it won't look like
Python! You can run it just like a regular Python file to see how your code should behave.
